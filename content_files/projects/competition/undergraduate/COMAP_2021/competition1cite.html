    abstract = {The article summarizes literature on college and university rankings worldwide and the strategies used
    by
    various ranking organizations, including those of government and popular media. It traces the history of national
    and
    global rankings, indicators used by ranking systems, and the effect of rankings on academic programs and their
    institutions. Although ranking systems employ diverse criteria and most weight certain indicators over others, there
    is
    considerable skepticism that most actually measure educational quality. At the same time, students and their
    families
    increasingly consult these evaluations when making college decisions, and sponsors of faculty research consider
    reputation when forming academic partnerships. While there are serious concerns regarding the validity of ranking
    institutions when so little data can support differences between one institution and another, college rankings
    appear to
    be here to stay.}
